## Previously Documented Superpowers Skills

### 1. using-superpowers
- **Description**: Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills
- **Core Principle**: If there's even a 1% chance a skill might apply, you MUST invoke the skill
- **Key Rule**: Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action

### 2. writing-skills
- **Description**: Use when creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment
- **Core Principle**: Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation
- **Workflow**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for skill development

### 3. writing-plans
- **Description**: Use when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code
- **Core Principle**: Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context
- **Structure**: Bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each) with exact commands and expected outcomes

### 4. executing-plans
- **Description**: Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute in a separate session with review checkpoints
- **Core Principle**: Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review
- **Workflow**: Load plan → Execute batch → Report → Continue until complete

### 5. using-git-worktrees
- **Description**: Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace
- **Core Principle**: Systematic directory selection + safety verification = reliable isolation
- **Process**: Directory selection → Safety verification → Worktree creation → Setup → Baseline verification

### 6. brainstorming
- **Description**: Use before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality
- **Core Principle**: Turn ideas into fully formed designs through natural collaborative dialogue
- **Process**: Understand → Explore approaches → Present design in sections

## Skills Related to Your Inquiry

Based on deeper search, here are skills that may relate to your inquiry:

### Business Innovation Pathway Planning
Found at: C:\Users\Zhang\.stigmergy\skills\digital-transformation\business-innovation-pathway-planning.SKILL.md
- **Description**: Planning specific business innovation implementation paths based on deconstruction analysis and niche identification results, including technology roadmap, implementation steps, resource allocation and risk control.
- **Core Functions**: Technology roadmap planning, implementation step design, resource allocation optimization, risk control mechanisms, value realization pathways.

### Field Expert Analysis (Possible "skill-from-masters" equivalent)
Found at: C:\Users\Zhang\.agent\skills\field-expert\SKILL.md
- **Description**: Bourdieu field theory expert analysis skill that integrates field boundary identification, capital analysis, habitus analysis, and field dynamics analysis functions.
- **Core Functions**: Boundary analysis, capital distribution analysis, habitus analysis, field dynamics analysis.
- **May be equivalent to** what you referred to as "skill-from-masters" as it represents expert-level analytical capability.

### Skills Actually Found in Directory

The following skills were actually found in your system:
- executing-plans
- writing-plans
- digital-transformation (main skill for transformation strategy)
- business-innovation-pathway-planning (sub-skill for planning implementation paths)
- field-expert (expert-level analysis skill, possibly equivalent to "skill-from-masters")

### Skills Actually Found (Previously Missing)

The following skills that were mentioned have now been located in the project:

#### skill-from-masters
Found at: D:\AIDevelop\failureLogic\skill-from-masters\skill-from-masters\SKILL.md
- **Description**: Help users create high-quality skills by discovering and incorporating proven methodologies from domain experts. Use this skill BEFORE skill-creator when users want to create a new skill - it enhances skill-creator by first identifying expert frameworks and best practices to incorporate.
- **Core Philosophy**: Create skills that embody the wisdom of domain masters by discovering and incorporating proven methodologies from recognized experts.
- **Key Features**: Includes a 5-layer narrowing framework, methodology research, golden examples identification, and cross-validation.

#### planning-with-files (previously misidentified as "planing-with-files")
Found at: D:\AIDevelop\failureLogic\planning-with-files\.agent\skills\planning-with-files\SKILL.md
- **Description**: Implements Manus-style file-based planning for complex tasks. Creates task_plan.md, findings.md, and progress.md. Use when starting complex multi-step tasks, research projects, or any task requiring >5 tool calls.
- **Core Principle**: Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited), Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)
- **Key Files**: task_plan.md (track phases and progress), findings.md (store research and discoveries), progress.md (session log and test results)

### Additional Notes

I did not find a built-in "skill-search" function among the available skills. The search was conducted manually through filesystem exploration and content analysis.

## Key Superpowers Principles

1. **Discipline First**: Always check for applicable skills before acting
2. **Test-Driven Documentation**: Apply TDD principles to skill development
3. **Bite-Sized Tasks**: Break work into 2-5 minute chunks
4. **Isolation**: Use git worktrees for safe experimentation
5. **Verification**: Check before proceeding, especially with safety concerns
