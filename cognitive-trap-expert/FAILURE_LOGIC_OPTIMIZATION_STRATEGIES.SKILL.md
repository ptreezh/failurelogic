# Failure Logic Optimization Strategies for Cognitive Trap Platform

## Strategy 1: Multi-Stage Decision Process Enhancement

### Current State Analysis
- The platform has a 4+ stage learning process (confusion → bias detection → advanced feedback)
- Backend supports extended gameplay but frontend may limit actual implementation
- Need to ensure all stages are fully utilized

### Optimization Approaches
1. **Extend Frontend Turn Count**: Modify JavaScript frontends to support more turns
2. **Deepen Each Stage**: Add more nuanced feedback in each phase
3. **Increase Scenario Complexity**: Create scenarios that genuinely require 5+ turns

### Implementation Steps
- Update app.js to support extended turn sequences
- Add intermediate checkpoints in long scenarios
- Create "deep dive" scenarios with 8+ decision points
- Implement dynamic scenario length based on user progress
